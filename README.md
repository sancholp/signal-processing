# Signal Processing

Playground for experimenting with signal processing techniques, both for detection and estimation.

These techniques have a wide array of applications, such as for the design of experiments.

## 1. `signal_detection.ipynb`: Start with a simple problem, and generalize progressively
- Signal in WGN
- Known signal
- Signal with unknown amplitude
- Signal at unknown location
